c:\projects\SkillHive\backend\src\app.js
Purpose:
The main entry point for your backend server. Sets up the Express app, applies middleware, and connects route modules.

c:\projects\SkillHive\backend\src\models\user.js
Purpose:
Defines and exports user data. In a real project, this would interface with a database. For now, it holds a sample user in an array.

c:\projects\SkillHive\backend\src\config\secret.js
Purpose:
Stores and exports configuration values, such as your JWT secret. Keeps sensitive or environment-specific data separate from logic.

c:\projects\SkillHive\backend\src\routes\auth.js
Purpose:
Handles authentication-related endpoints (e.g., /api/login).

Checks credentials against the user model.
Issues JWT tokens on successful login.
c:\projects\SkillHive\backend\src\routes\protected.js
Purpose:
Handles endpoints that require authentication (e.g., /api/protected).

Verifies JWT tokens.
Returns protected data if the token is valid.
